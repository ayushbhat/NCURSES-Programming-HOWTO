    int bkgrnd( const cchar_t *wch);
    int wbkgrnd( WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch);
    void bkgrndset(const cchar_t *wch );
    void wbkgrndset(WINDOW *win, const cchar_t *wch);

  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

** bkgrndset

   The =bkgrndset= and =wbkgrndset= routines manipulate the background
   of the named window.  The window background is a =cchar_t=
   consisting of any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a
   complex character.  The attribute part of the background is
   combined (OR'ed) with all non-blank characters that are written
   into the window with =waddch=.  Both the character and attribute
   parts of the background are combined with the blank characters.
   The background becomes a property of the character and moves with
   the character through any scrolling and insert/delete
   line/character operations.

   To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part
   of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the
   character put on the screen.

** bkgrnd

   The =bkgrnd= and =wbkgrnd= functions set the background property of
   the current or specified window and then apply this setting to
   every character position in that window:

   * The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to the
     new background rendition.

   * Wherever the former background character appears, it is changed
     to the new background character.

** getbkgrnd

   The =getbkgrnd= function returns the given window's current
   background character/attribute pair via the /wch/ pointer.

* NOTES

  Note that =bkgrnd=, =bkgrndset=, and =getbkgrnd= may be macros.

* RETURN VALUE

  The =bkgrndset= and =wbkgrndset= routines do not return a value.

  Upon successful completion, the other functions return =OK=.
  Otherwise, they return =ERR=.  A null window pointer is treated as
  an error.
