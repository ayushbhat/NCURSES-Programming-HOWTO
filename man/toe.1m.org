* NAME

  =toe= - table of (terminfo) entries

* SYNOPSIS

  =toe= [-v[n]] [-ahsuUV] file...

* DESCRIPTION

  With no options, =toe= lists all available terminal types by primary
  name with descriptions.  File arguments specify the directories to
  be scanned; if no such arguments are given, your default terminfo
  directory is scanned.  If you also specify the =-h= option, a
  directory header will be issued as each directory is entered.

  There are other options intended for use by terminfo file
  maintainers:

  * =-a= ::

    report on all of the terminal databases which =ncurses= would
    search, rather than only the first one that it finds.

    If the =-s= is also given, =toe= adds a column to the report,
    showing (like =conflict(1)=) which entries which belong to a given
    terminal database.  An "*" marks entries which differ, and "+"
    marks equivalent entries.

    Without the =-s= option, =toe= does not attempt to merge
    duplicates in its report

  * =-s= ::

    sort the output by the entry names.

  * =-u= /file/ ::

    says to write a report to the standard output, listing
    dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The
    report condenses the 'use' relation: each line consists of the
    primary name of a terminal that has use capabilities, followed by
    a colon, followed by the whitespace-separated primary names of all
    terminals which occur in those use capabilities, followed by a
    newline

  * =-U= /file/ ::

    says to write a report to the standard output, listing reverse
    dependencies in the given terminfo/termcap source file.  The
    report reverses the 'use' relation: each line consists of the
    primary name of a terminal that occurs in use capabilities,
    followed by a colon, followed by the whitespaceseparated primary
    names of all terminals which depend on it, followed by a newline.

  * =-vn= ::

    specifies that (verbose) output be written to standard error,
    showing =toe='s progress.  The optional parameter /n/ is a number
    from 1 to 10, interpreted as for [[file:tic.1m.org][tic(1m)]].

  * =-V= ::

    reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
    exits.

* FILES

  - =/usr/share/terminfo/?/*= :: Compiled terminal description
                                 database.
