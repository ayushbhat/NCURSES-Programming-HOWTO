* NAME

  =form_field_opts= - set and get field options

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_field_opts(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
    int field_opts_on(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
    int field_opts_off(FIELD *field, Field_Options opts);
    Field_Options field_opts(const FIELD *field);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_field_opts= sets all the given field's option bits
  (field option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).

  The function =field_opts_on= turns on the given option bits, and
  leaves others alone.

  The function =field_opts_off= turns off the given option bits, and
  leaves others alone.

  The function =field_opts= returns the field's current option bits.

  The following standard options are defined (all are on by default):

  * =O_ACTIVE= ::

    The field is visited during processing.  If this option is off,
    the field will not be reachable by navigation keys.  Please notice
    that an invisible field appears to be inactive also.

  * =O_AUTOSKIP= ::

    Skip to the next field when this one fills.

  * =O_BLANK= ::

    The field is cleared whenever a character is entered at the first
    position.

  * =O_EDIT= ::

    The field can be edited.

  * =O_NULLOK= ::

    Allow a blank field.

  * =O_PASSOK= ::

    Validate field only if modified by user.

  * =O_PUBLIC= ::

    The field contents are displayed as data is entered.

  * =O_STATIC= ::

    Field buffers are fixed to field's original size.  Turn this
    option off to create a dynamic field.

  * =O_VISIBLE= ::

    The field is displayed.  If this option is off, display of the
    field is suppressed.

  * =O_WRAP= ::

    Words that do not fit on a line are wrapped to the next line.
    Words are blank-separated.

  One extension option is defined (extensions are off by default):

  * =O_DYNAMIC_JUSTIFY= ::

    Permit dynamic fields to be justified, like static fields.

* RETURN VALUE

  Except for field_opts, each routine returns one of the following:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_CURRENT=      :: The field is the current field.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
