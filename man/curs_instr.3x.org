* NAME

  =instr=, =innstr=, =winstr=, =winnstr=, =mvinstr=, =mvinnstr=,
  =mvwinstr=, =mvwinnstr= - get a string of characters from a =curses=
  window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int instr(char *str);
    int innstr(char *str, int n);
    int winstr(WINDOW *win, char *str);
    int winnstr(WINDOW *win, char *str, int n);
    int mvinstr(int y, int x, char *str);
    int mvinnstr(int y, int x, char *str, int n);
    int mvwinstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, char *str);
    int  mvwinnstr(WINDOW  *win,  int y, int x, char *str, int
    n);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines return a string of characters in str, extracted
  starting at the current cursor position in the named window.
  Attributes are stripped from the characters.  The four functions
  with /n/ as the last argument return a leading substring at most /n/
  characters long (exclusive of the trailing =NUL=).

* RETURN VALUE

  All of the functions return =ERR= upon failure, or the number of
  characters actually read into the string.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation, if the
  window parameter is null or the str parameter is null, a zero is
  returned.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that all routines except =winnstr= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  SVr4 does not document whether a length limit includes or excludes
  the trailing NUL.

  The ncurses library extends the XSI description by allowing a
  negative value for n.  In this case, the functions return the string
  ending at the right margin.
