* NAME

  =getcchar=, =setcchar= - Get a wide character string and rendition
  from a =cchar_t= or set a =cchar_t= from a wide-character string

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int getcchar(
            const cchar_t *wcval,
            wchar_t *wch,
            attr_t *attrs,
            short *color_pair,
            void *opts );

    int setcchar(
            cchar_t *wcval,
            const wchar_t *wch,
            const attr_t attrs,
            short color_pair,
            void *opts );
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

** getcchar

   The =getcchar= function gets a wide-character string and rendition
   from a =cchar_t= argument.  When /wch/ is not a null pointer, the
   =getcchar= function does the following:

   * Extracts information from a =cchar_t= value /wcval/

   * Stores the character attributes in the location pointed to by
     /attrs/

   * Stores the color-pair in the location pointed to by /color_pair/

   * Stores the wide-character string, characters referenced by
     /wcval/, into the array pointed to by /wch/.


   When /wch/ is a null pointer, the =getcchar= function does the
   following:

   * Obtains the number of wide characters pointed to by /wcval/

   * Does not change the data referenced by /attrs/ or /color_pair/

** setcchar

   The setcchar function initializes the location pointed to by
   /wcval/ by using:

   * The character attributes in /attrs/

   * The color pair in /color_pair/

   * The wide-character string pointed to by /wch/.  The string must
     be L'\0' terminated, contain at most one spacing character, which
     must be the first.

     Up to =CCHARW_MAX-1= nonspacing characters may follow.
     Additional nonspacing characters are ignored.

     The string may contain a single control character instead.  In
     that case, no nonspacing characters are allowed.

* NOTES

  The /opts/ argument is reserved for future use.  Currently, an
  application must provide a null pointer as /opts/.

  The /wcval/ argument may be a value generated by a call to setcchar
  or by a function that has a =cchar_t= output argument.  If /wcval/
  is constructed by any other means, the effect is unspecified.

* RETURN VALUE

  When /wch/ is a null pointer, =getcchar= returns the number of wide
  characters referenced by /wcval/, including one for a trailing null.

  When /wch/ is not a null pointer, =getcchar= returns =OK= upon
  successful completion, and =ERR= otherwise.

  Upon successful completion, setcchar returns =OK=.  Otherwise, it
  returns =ERR=.
