* NAME

  =infotocap= - convert a =terminfo= description into a termcap
  description

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    infotocap [-vn width] [-V] [-1] [-w width] file . . .
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* DESCRIPTION

  =infotocap= looks in each given text file for =terminfo=
  descriptions.  For each =terminfo= description found, an equivalent
  =termcap= description is written to standard output.  Terminfo =use=
  capabilities are translated directly to termcap =tc= capabilities.

  * =-v= :: print out tracing information on standard error as the
            program runs.

  * =-V= :: print out the version of the program in use on standard
            error and exit.

  * =-1= :: cause the fields to print out one to a line.  Otherwise,
            the fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum
            width of 60 characters.

  * =-w= :: change the output to width characters.

* FILES

  /usr/share/terminfo Compiled terminal description database.

* NOTES

  This utility is actually a link to tic, running in =-C= mode.  You
  can use other tic options such as =-f= and =-x=.
