* NAME

  =delch=, =wdelch=, =mvdelch=, =mvwdelch= - delete character under
  the cursor in a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int delch(void);
    int wdelch(WINDOW *win);
    int mvdelch(int y, int x);
    int mvwdelch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines delete the character under the cursor; all characters
  to the right of the cursor on the same line are moved to the left
  one position and the last character on the line is filled with a
  blank.  The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x,
  if specified).  (This does not imply use of the hardware delete
  character feature.)

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and an =OK= (SVr4
  specifies only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon successful
  completion.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that =delch=, =mvdelch=, and =mvwdelch= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  The standard specifies that they return =ERR= on failure, but
  specifies no error conditions.
