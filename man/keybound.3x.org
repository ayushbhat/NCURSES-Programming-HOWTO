* NAME

  =keybound= - return definition of keycode

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    char * keybound(int keycode, int count);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This is an extension to the =curses= library.  It permits an
  application to determine the string which is defined in the
  =terminfo= for specific keycodes.

* RETURN VALUE

  The /keycode/ parameter must be greater than zero, else =NULL= is
  returned.  If it does not correspond to a defined key, then =NULL=
  is returned.  The count parameter is used to allow the application
  to iterate through multiple definitions, counting from zero.  When
  successful, the function returns a string which must be freed by the
  caller.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
