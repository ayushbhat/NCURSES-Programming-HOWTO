* NAME

  =deleteln=, =wdeleteln=, =insdelln=, =winsdelln=, =insertln=,
  =winsertln= - delete and insert lines in a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int deleteln(void);
    int wdeleteln(WINDOW *win);
    int insdelln(int n);
    int winsdelln(WINDOW *win, int n);
    int insertln(void);
    int winsertln(WINDOW *win);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =deleteln= and =wdeleteln= routines delete the line under the
  cursor in the window; all lines below the current line are moved up
  one line.  The bottom line of the window is cleared.  The cursor
  position does not change.

  The =insdelln= and =winsdelln= routines, for positive n, insert /n/
  lines into the specified window above the current line.  The /n/
  bottom lines are lost.  For negative n, delete /n/ lines (starting
  with the one under the cursor), and move the remaining lines up.
  The bottom /n/ lines are cleared.  The current cursor position
  remains the same.

  The =insertln= and =winsertln= routines insert a blank line above
  the current line and the bottom line is lost.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines return the integer =ERR= upon failure and an =OK= (SVr4
  specifies only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon successful
  completion.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation, if the
  window parameter is null, an error is returned.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  The standard specifies that they return =ERR= on failure, but
  specifies no error conditions.

* NOTES

  Note that all but =winsdelln= may be macros.

  These routines do not require a hardware line delete or insert
  feature in the terminal.  In fact, they will not use hardware line
  delete/insert unless =idlok(..., TRUE)= has been set on the current
  window.
