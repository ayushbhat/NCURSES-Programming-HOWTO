* NAME

  =in_wch=, =mvin_wch=, =mvwin_wch=, =win_wch= - extract a complex
  character and rendition from a window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int in_wch(cchar_t *wcval);
    int mvin_wch(int y, int x, cchar_t *wcval);
    int mvwin_wch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, cchar_t *wcval);
    int win_wch(WINDOW *win, cchar_t *wcval);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These functions extract the complex character and rendition from the
  current position in the named window into the =cchar_t= object
  referenced by /wcval/.

* RETURN VALUE

  No errors are defined in the XSI Curses standard.  This
  implementation checks for null pointers, returns =ERR= in that case.
  Also, the /mv/ routines check for error moving the cursor, returning
  =ERR= in that case.  Otherwise they return =OK=

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that all of these routines may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
