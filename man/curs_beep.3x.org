* NAME

  =beep=, =flash= - =curses= bell and screen flash routines

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int beep(void);
    int flash(void);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =beep= and =flash= routines are used to alert the terminal user.
  The routine =beep= sounds an audible alarm on the terminal, if
  possible; otherwise it flashes the screen (visible bell).  The
  routine =flash= flashes the screen, and if that is not possible,
  sounds the alert.  If neither alert is possible, nothing happens.
  Nearly all terminals have an audible alert (bell or beep), but only
  some can flash the screen.

* RETURN VALUE

  These routines return =OK= if they succeed in beeping or flashing,
  =ERR= otherwise.

* EXTENSIONS

  SVr4's =beep= and =flash= routines always returned =OK=, so it was
  not possible to tell when the beep or flash failed.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
  Like SVr4, it specifies that they always return =OK=.
