* NAME

  =getyx=, =getparyx=, =getbegyx=, =getmaxyx= - get =curses= cursor
  and window coordinates

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    void getyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
    void getparyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
    void getbegyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
    void getmaxyx(WINDOW *win, int y, int x);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =getyx= macro places the current cursor position of the given
  window in the two integer variables y and x.

  If /win/ is a subwindow, the =getparyx= macro places the beginning
  coordinates of the subwindow relative to the parent window into two
  integer variables =y= and =x=.  Otherwise, =-1= is placed into y and
  =x=.

  Like =getyx=, the =getbegyx= and =getmaxyx= macros store the current
  beginning coordinates and size of the specified window.

* RETURN VALUE

  The return values of these macros are undefined (i.e., they should
  not be used as the right-hand side of assignment statements).

* NOTES

  All of these interfaces are macros.  A "=&=" is not necessary before
  the variables =y= and =x=.

* PORTABILITY

  The =getyx=, =getparyx=, =getbegyx= and =getmaxyx= macros are
  described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.

  This implementation also provides functions =getbegx=, =getbegy=,
  =getcurx=, =getcury=, =getmaxx=, =getmaxy=, =getparx= and =getpary=
  for compatibility with older versions of curses.

  Although X/Open Curses does not address this, many implementations
  provide members of the =WINDOW= structure containing values
  corresponding to these macros.  For best portability, do not rely on
  using the data in =WINDOW=, since some implementations make =WINDOW=
  opaque (do not allow direct use of its members).

  Besides the problem of opaque structures, the data stored in
  like-named members may not have like-values in different
  implementations.  For example, the =WINDOW._maxx= and =WINDOW._maxy=
  values in =ncurses= have (at least since release 1.8.1) differed by
  one from some other implementations.  The difference is hidden by
  means of the macro =getmaxyx=.
