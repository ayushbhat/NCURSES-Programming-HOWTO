* NAME

  =wresize= - resize a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int wresize(WINDOW *win, int lines, int columns);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This is an extension to the curses library.  It reallocates storage
  for an =ncurses= window to adjust its dimensions to the specified
  values.  If either dimension is larger than the current values, the
  window's data is filled with blanks that have the current background
  rendition (as set by =wbkgdset=) merged into them.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function returns the integer =ERR= upon failure and =OK= on
  success.  It will fail if either of the dimensions less than or
  equal to zero, or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory for
  the window.

* NOTES

  The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they be
  greater than zero.  The dimensions are not compared to =curses=
  screen dimensions to simplify the logic of =resizeterm=.  The caller
  must ensure that the window's dimensions fit within the actual
  screen dimensions.

* PORTABILITY

  It is not possible to resize windows with SVr4 curses.

  This extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.  It was
  adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).

  Thomas Dickey (from an equivalent function written in 1988 for BSD
  =curses=).
