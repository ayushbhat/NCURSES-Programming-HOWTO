* NAME

  =form_win= - make and break form window and subwindow associations

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_form_win(FORM *form, WINDOW *win);
    WINDOW *form_win(const FORM *form);
    int set_form_sub(FORM *form, WINDOW *sub);
    WINDOW *form_sub(const FORM *form);
    int scale_form(const FORM *form, int *rows, int *columns);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Every form has an associated pair of =curses= windows.  The form
  window displays any title and border associated with the window; the
  form subwindow displays the items of the form that are currently
  available for selection.

  The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is not
  necessary to set either window; by default, the driver code uses
  =stdscr= for both.

  In the =set_= functions, window argument of =NULL= is treated as
  though it were =stsdcr=.  A form argument of =NULL= is treated as a
  request to change the system default form window or subwindow.

  The function =scale_form= returns the minimum size required for the
  subwindow of form.

* RETURN VALUE

  Routines that return pointers return =NULL= on error.  Routines that
  return an integer return one of the following error codes:

  - =E_OK=            :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR=  :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT=  :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                         argument.

  - =E_POSTED=        :: The form has already been posted.

  - =E_NOT_CONNECTED= :: No items are connected to the form.

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
