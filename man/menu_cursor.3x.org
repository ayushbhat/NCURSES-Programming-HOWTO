* NAME

  =pos_menu_cursor= - position a menu's cursor

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int pos_menu_cursor(const MENU *menu);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =pos_menu_cursor= restores the cursor to the current
  position associated with the menu's selected item.  This is useful
  after =curses= routines have been called to do screen-painting in
  response to a menu select.

* RETURN VALUE

  This routine returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  - =E_NOT_POSTED=   :: The menu has not been posted.

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:menu.3x.org][menu(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
