* NAME

  =mitem_visible= - check visibility of a menu item

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    bool item_visible(const ITEM *item);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  A menu item is visible when it is in the portion of a posted menu
  that is mapped onto the screen (if the menu is scrollable, in
  particular, this portion will be smaller than the whole menu).

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:menu.3x.org][menu(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  S. Raymond.
