* NAME

  =form_field= - make and break connections between fields and forms

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    int set_form_fields(FORM *form, FIELD **fields);
    FIELD **form_fields(const FORM *form);
    int field_count(const FORM *form);
    int move_field(FIELD *field, int frow, int fcol);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_form_fields= changes the field pointer array of
  the given form.  The array must be terminated by a =NULL=.

  The function =form_fields= returns the field array of the given
  form.

  The function =field_count= returns the count of fields in form.

  The function =move_field= moves the given field (which must be
  disconnected) to a specified location on the screen.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =form_fields= returns a pointer (which may be =NULL=).
  It does not set =errno=.

  The function =field_count= returns =ERR= if the form parameter is
  =NULL=.

  The functions =set_form_fields= and =move_field= return one of the
  following codes on error:

  * =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  * =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  * =E_CONNECTED=    :: The field is already connected to a form.

  * =E_POSTED=       :: The form is already posted.

  * =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred (see =errno=).

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:form.3x.org][form(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<form.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  The SVr4 forms library documentation specifies the =field_count=
  error value as =-1= (which is the value of =ERR=).
