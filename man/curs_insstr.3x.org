* NAME

  =insstr=, =insnstr=, =winsstr=, =winsnstr=, =mvinsstr=, =mvinsnstr=,
  =mvwinsstr=, =mvwinsnstr= - insert string before cursor in a
  =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>
    int insstr(const char *str);
    int insnstr(const char *str, int n);
    int winsstr(WINDOW *win, const char *str);
    int winsnstr(WINDOW *win, const char *str, int n);
    int mvinsstr(int y, int x, const char *str);
    int mvinsnstr(int y, int x, const char *str, int n);
    int mvwinsstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const char *str);
    int mvwinsnstr(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, const char *str,
    int n);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines insert a character string (as many characters as will
  fit on the line) before the character under the cursor.  All
  characters to the right of the cursor are shifted right with the
  possibility of the rightmost characters on the line being lost.  The
  cursor position does not change (after moving to =y=, =x=, if
  specified).  The functions with /n/ as the last argument insert a
  leading substring of at most /n/ characters.  If n<=0, then the
  entire string is inserted.

  Special characters are handled as in =addch=.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure and
  =OK= (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon
  successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding
  routine descriptions.

  X/Open defines no error conditions.  In this implementation, if the
  window parameter is null or the str parameter is null, an error is
  returned.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  Note that all but winsnstr may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4,
  which adds const qualifiers to the arguments.

  The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that =insnstr= and
  =winsnstr= perform wrapping.  This is probably an error, since it
  makes this group of functions inconsistent.  Also, no implementation
  of =curses= documents this inconsistency.
