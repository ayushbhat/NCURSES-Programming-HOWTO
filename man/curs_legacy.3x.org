* NAME

  =curs_legacy= - get =curses= cursor and window coordinates,
  attributes

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include =<curses.h>=

    int getattrs(WINDOW *win);
    int getbegx(WINDOW *win);
    int getbegy(WINDOW *win);
    int getcurx(WINDOW *win);
    int getcury(WINDOW *win);
    int getmaxx(WINDOW *win);
    int getmaxy(WINDOW *win);
    int getparx(WINDOW *win);
    int getpary(WINDOW *win);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The getbegy and =getbegx= functions return the same data as
  =getbegyx=.

  The =getcury= and =getcurx= functions return the same data as =getyx=.

  The =getmaxy= and =getmaxx= functions return the same data as
  =getmaxyx=.

  The =getpary= and =getparx= functions return the same data as
  =getparyx=.

* RETURN VALUE

  These functions return an integer, or =ERR= if the window parameter
  is null.

* NOTES

  All of these interfaces are provided as macros and functions.  The
  macros are suppressed (and only the functions provided) when
  =NCURSES_OPAQUE= is defined.  The standard forms such as =getyx=
  must be implemented as macros, and (in this implementation) are
  defined in terms of the functions described here, to avoid reliance
  on internal details of the =WINDOW= structure.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions were supported on Version 7, BSD or System V
  implementations.
