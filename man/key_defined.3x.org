* NAME

  =key_defined= - check if a keycode is defined

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int key_defined(const char *definition);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This is an extension to the =curses= library.  It permits an
  application to determine if a string is currently bound to any
  keycode.

* RETURN VALUE

  If the string is bound to a keycode, its value (greater than zero)
  is returned.  If no keycode is bound, zero is returned.  If the
  string conflicts with longer strings which are bound to keys, -1 is
  returned.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
