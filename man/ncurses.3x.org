* NAME

  =ncurses= - CRT screen handling and optimization package

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The =ncurses= library routines give the user a terminalindependent
  method of updating character screens with reasonable optimization.
  This implementation is "new curses" (ncurses) and is the approved
  replacement for 4.4BSD classic =curses=, which has been
  discontinued.  This describes =ncurses= version 6.0 (patch
  20160130).

  The =ncurses= library emulates the =curses= library of System V
  Release 4 UNIX, and XPG4 (X/Open Portability Guide) =curses= (also
  known as XSI curses).  XSI stands for X/Open System Interfaces
  Extension.  The =ncurses= library is freely redistributable in
  source form.  Differences from the SVr4 =curses= are summarized
  under the *EXTENSIONS* and *PORTABILITY* sections below and
  described in detail in the respective *EXTENSIONS*, *PORTABILITY*
  and *BUGS* sections of individual man pages.

  The =ncurses= library also provides many useful extensions, i.e.,
  features which cannot be implemented by a simple add-on library but
  which require access to the internals of the library.

  A program using these routines must be linked with the =-lncurses=
  option, or (if it has been generated) with the debugging library
  =-lncurses_g=.  (Your system integrator may also have installed
  these libraries under the names =-lcurses= and =-lcurses_g=.)  The
  =ncurses_g= library generates trace logs (in a file called 'trace'
  in the current directory) that describe =curses= actions.  See also
  the section on *ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS*.

  The =ncurses= package supports: overall screen, window and pad
  manipulation; output to windows and pads; reading terminal input;
  control over terminal and =curses= input and output options;
  environment query routines; color manipulation; use of soft label
  keys; terminfo capabilities; and access to low-level
  terminal-manipulation routines.

** Initialization

   The library uses the locale which the calling program has
   initialized.  That is normally done with =setlocale=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
   #+END_SRC

   If the locale is not initialized, the library assumes that
   characters are printable as in ISO-8859-1, to work with certain
   legacy programs.  You should initialize the locale and not rely on
   specific details of the library when the locale has not been setup.

   The function =initscr= or =newterm= must be called to initialize
   the library before any of the other routines that deal with windows
   and screens are used.  The routine =endwin= must be called before
   exiting.

   To get character-at-a-time input without echoing (most interactive,
   screen oriented programs want this), the following sequence should
   be used:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     initscr(); cbreak(); noecho();
   #+END_SRC

   Most programs would additionally use the sequence:

   #+BEGIN_SRC c
     nonl();
     intrflush(stdscr, FALSE);
     keypad(stdscr, TRUE);
   #+END_SRC

   Before a =curses= program is run, the tab stops of the terminal
   should be set and its initialization strings, if defined, must be
   output.  This can be done by executing the =tput init= command
   after the shell environment variable =TERM= has been exported.
   [[file:tset.1.org][tset(1)]] is usually responsible for doing this.  [See [[file:terminfo.5.org][terminfo(5)]]
   for further details.]

** Datatypes

   The =ncurses= library permits manipulation of data structures,
   called /windows/, which can be thought of as two-dimensional arrays
   of characters representing all or part of a CRT screen.  A default
   window called =stdscr=, which is the size of the terminal screen,
   is supplied.  Others may be created with =newwin=.

   Note that =curses= does not handle overlapping windows, that's done
   by the [[file:panel.3x.org][panel(3x)]] library.  This means that you can either use
   =stdscr= or divide the screen into tiled windows and not using
   =stdscr= at all.  Mixing the two will result in unpredictable, and
   undesired, effects.

   Windows are referred to by variables declared as =WINDOW *=.  These
   data structures are manipulated with routines described here and
   elsewhere in the =ncurses= manual pages.  Among those, the most
   basic routines are =move= and =addch=.  More general versions of
   these routines are included with names beginning with w, allowing
   the user to specify a window.  The routines not beginning with =w=
   affect =stdscr=.

   After using routines to manipulate a window, =refresh= is called,
   telling =curses= to make the user's CRT screen look like =stdscr=.
   The characters in a window are actually of type =chtype=,
   (character and attribute data) so that other information about the
   character may also be stored with each character.

   Special windows called pads may also be manipulated.  These are
   windows which are not constrained to the size of the screen and
   whose contents need not be completely displayed.  See [[file:curs_pad.3x.org][curs_pad(3x)]]
   for more information.

   In addition to drawing characters on the screen, video attributes
   and colors may be supported, causing the characters to show up in
   such modes as underlined, in reverse video, or in color on
   terminals that support such display enhancements.  Line drawing
   characters may be specified to be output.  On input, =curses= is
   also able to translate arrow and function keys that transmit escape
   sequences into single values.  The video attributes, line drawing
   characters, and input values use names, defined in =<curses.h>=,
   such as =A_REVERSE=, =ACS_HLINE=, and =KEY_LEFT=.

** Environment variables

   If the environment variables =LINES= and =COLUMNS= are set, or if
   the program is executing in a window environment, line and column
   information in the environment will override information read by
   =terminfo=.  This would affect a program running in an AT&T 630
   layer, for example, where the size of a screen is changeable (see
   =ENVIRONMENT=).

   If the environment variable =TERMINFO= is defined, any program
   using =curses= checks for a local terminal definition before
   checking in the standard place.  For example, if =TERM= is set to
   =att4424=, then the compiled terminal definition is found in

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     /usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424.
   #+END_SRC

   (The =a= is copied from the first letter of =att4424= to avoid
   creation of huge directories.)  However, if =TERMINFO= is set to
   =$HOME/myterms=, =curses= first checks

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $HOME/myterms/a/att4424,
   #+END_SRC

   and if that fails, it then checks

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     /usr/share/terminfo/a/att4424.
   #+END_SRC

   This is useful for developing experimental definitions or when
   write permission in =/usr/share/terminfo= is not available.

   The integer variables =LINES= and =COLS= are defined in
   =<curses.h>= and will be filled in by =initscr= with the size of
   the screen.  The constants =TRUE= and =FALSE= have the values 1 and
   0, respectively.

   The =curses= routines also define the =WINDOW *= variable =curscr=
   which is used for certain low-level operations like clearing and
   redrawing a screen containing garbage.  The =curscr= can be used in
   only a few routines.

** Routine and Argument Names

   Many =curses= routines have two or more versions.  The routines
   prefixed with =w= require a window argument.  The routines prefixed
   with =p= require a pad argument.  Those without a prefix generally
   use =stdscr=.

   The routines prefixed with /mv/ require a =y= and =x= coordinate to
   move to before performing the appropriate action.  The /mv/
   routines imply a call to =move= before the call to the other
   routine.  The coordinate =y= always refers to the row (of the
   window), and =x= always refers to the column.  The upper left-hand
   corner is always (0,0), not (1,1).

   The routines prefixed with /mvw/ take both a window argument and
   =x= and =y= coordinates.  The window argument is always specified
   before the coordinates.

   In each case, /win/ is the window affected, and pad is the pad
   affected; /win/ and /pad/ are always pointers to type =WINDOW=.

   Option setting routines require a Boolean flag /bf/ with the value
   =TRUE= or =FALSE=; /bf/ is always of type =bool=.  Most of the data
   types used in the library routines, such as =WINDOW=, =SCREEN=,
   =bool=, and =chtype= are defined in =<curses.h>=.  Types used for
   the terminfo routines such as =TERMINAL= are defined in <term.h>.

   This manual page describes functions which may appear in any
   configuration of the library.  There are two common configurations
   of the library:

   - /ncurses/ ::

     the "normal" library, which handles 8-bit characters.  The normal
     (8-bit) library stores characters combined with attributes in
     =chtype= data.

     Attributes alone (no corresponding character) may be stored in
     =chtype= or the equivalent =attr_t= data. In either case, the
     data is stored in something like an integer.

     Each cell (row and column) in a =WINDOW= is stored as a =chtype=.

   - /ncursesw/ ::

     the so-called "wide" library, which handles multibyte characters
     (see the section on *ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS*).  The "wide"
     library includes all of the calls from the "normal" library.  It
     adds about one third more calls using data types which store
     multibyte characters:

     - =cchar_t= ::

       corresponds to =chtype=.  However it is a structure, because
       more data is stored than can fit into an integer.  The
       characters are large enough to require a full integer value -
       and there may be more than one character per cell.  The video
       attributes and color are stored in separate fields of the
       structure.

       Each cell (row and column) in a =WINDOW= is stored as a
       =cchar_t=.

     - =wchar_t= ::

       stores a "wide" character.  Like =chtype=, this may be an
       integer.

     - wint_t ::

       stores a =wchar_t= or =WEOF= - not the same, though both may
       have the same size.

     The "wide" library provides new functions which are analogous to
     functions in the "normal" library.  There is a naming convention
     which relates many of the normal/wide variants: a "_w" is
     inserted into the name.  For example, =waddch= becomes
     =wadd_wch=.

* RETURN VALUE

  Routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure and an
  integer value other than =ERR= upon successful completion, unless
  otherwise noted in the routine descriptions.

  As a general rule, routines check for null pointers passed as
  parameters, and handle this as an error.

  All macros return the value of the =w= version, except =setscrreg=,
  =wsetscrreg=, =getyx=, =getbegyx=, and =getmaxyx=.  The return
  values of =setscrreg=, =wsetscrreg=, =getyx=, =getbegyx=, and
  =getmaxyx= are undefined (i.e., these should not be used as the
  right-hand side of assignment statements).

  Routines that return pointers return =NULL= on error.

* ENVIRONMENT

  The following environment symbols are useful for customizing the
  runtime behavior of the =ncurses= library.  The most important ones
  have been already discussed in detail.


** CC

   When set, change occurrences of the command_character (i.e., the
   =cmdch= capability) of the loaded terminfo entries to the value of
   this variable.  Very few terminfo entries provide this feature.

   Because this name is also used in development environments to
   represent the C compiler's name, =ncurses= ignores it if it does
   not happen to be a single character.

* BAUDRATE

  The debugging library checks this environment variable when the
  application has redirected output to a file.  The variable's numeric
  value is used for the baudrate.  If no value is found, =ncurses=
  uses 9600.  This allows testers to construct repeatable test-cases
  that take into account costs that depend on baudrate.

* =COLUMNS=

  Specify the width of the screen in characters.  Applications running
  in a windowing environment usually are able to obtain the width of
  the window in which they are executing.  If neither the =COLUMNS=
  value nor the terminal's screen size is available, =ncurses= uses
  the size which may be specified in the terminfo database (i.e., the
  =cols= capability).

  It is important that your application use a correct size for the
  screen.  This is not always possible because your application may be
  running on a host which does not honor NAWS (Negotiations About
  Window Size), or because you are temporarily running as another
  user.  However, setting =COLUMNS= and/or =LINES= overrides the
  library's use of the screen size obtained from the operating system.

  Either =COLUMNS= or =LINES= symbols may be specified independently.
  This is mainly useful to circumvent legacy misfeatures of terminal
  descriptions, e.g., xterm which commonly specifies a 65 line screen.
  For best results, lines and cols should not be specified in a
  terminal description for terminals which are run as emulations.

  Use the =use_env= function to disable all use of external
  environment (but not including system calls) to determine the screen
  size.  Use the =use_tioctl= function to update =COLUMNS= or =LINES=
  to match the screen size obtained from system calls or the terminal
  database.

* =ESCDELAY=

  Specifies the total time, in milliseconds, for which =ncurses= will
  await a character sequence, e.g., a function key.  The default
  value, 1000 milliseconds, is enough for most uses.  However, it is
  made a variable to accommodate unusual applications.

  The most common instance where you may wish to change this value is
  to work with slow hosts, e.g., running on a network.  If the host
  cannot read characters rapidly enough, it will have the same effect
  as if the terminal did not send characters rapidly enough.  The
  library will still see a timeout.

  Note that xterm mouse events are built up from character sequences
  received from the xterm.  If your application makes heavy use of
  multiple-clicking, you may wish to lengthen this default value
  because the timeout applies to the composed multi-click event as
  well as the individual clicks.

  In addition to the environment variable, this implementation
  provides a global variable with the same name.  Portable
  applications should not rely upon the presence of =ESCDELAY= in
  either form, but setting the environment variable rather than the
  global variable does not create problems when compiling an
  application.

* =HOME=

  Tells =ncurses= where your home directory is.  That is where it may
  read and write auxiliary terminal descriptions:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    $HOME/.termcap
    $HOME/.terminfo
  #+END_SRC

* =LINES=

  Like =COLUMNS=, specify the height of the screen in characters.  See
  =COLUMNS= for a detailed description.

* =MOUSE_BUTTONS_123=

  This applies only to the OS/2 EMX port.  It specifies the order of
  buttons on the mouse.  OS/2 numbers a 3-button mouse inconsistently
  from other platforms:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    1 = left
    2 = right
    3 = middle.
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This variable lets you customize the mouse.  The variable must be
  three numeric digits 1-3 in any order, e.g., 123 or 321.  If it is
  not specified, =ncurses= uses 132.

* =NCURSES_ASSUMED_COLORS=

  Override the compiled-in assumption that the terminal's default
  colors are white-on-black (see [[file:default_colors.3x.org][default_colors(3x)]]).  You may set the
  foreground and background color values with this environment
  variable by proving a 2-element list: foreground,background.  For
  example, to tell =ncurses= to not assume anything about the colors,
  set this to "-1,-1".  To make it green-on-black, set it to "2,0".
  Any positive value from zero to the terminfo =max_colors= value is
  allowed.

* =NCURSES_CONSOLE2=

  This applies only to the MinGW port of ncurses.

  The *Console2* program's handling of the Microsoft Console API call
  *CreateConsoleScreenBuffer* is defective.  Applications which use
  this will hang.  However, it is possible to simulate the action of
  this call by mapping coordinates, explicitly saving and restoring
  the original screen contents.  Setting the environment variable
  =NCGDB= has the same effect.

* =NCURSES_GPM_TERMS=

  This applies only to =ncurses= configured to use the GPM interface.

  If present, the environment variable is a list of one or more
  terminal names against which the =TERM= environment variable is
  matched.  Setting it to an empty value disables the GPM interface;
  using the built-in support for xterm, etc.

  If the environment variable is absent, =ncurses= will attempt to
  open GPM if =TERM= contains "linux".

* =NCURSES_NO_HARD_TABS=

  =ncurses= may use tabs as part of the cursor movement optimization.
  In some cases, your terminal driver may not handle these properly.
  Set this environment variable to disable the feature.  You can also
  adjust your =stty= settings to avoid the problem.
  =NCURSES_NO_MAGIC_COOKIE= Some terminals use a magic-cookie feature
  which requires special handling to make highlighting and other video
  attributes display properly.  You can suppress the highlighting
  entirely for these terminals by setting this environment variable.

* =NCURSES_NO_PADDING=

  Most of the terminal descriptions in the terminfo database are
  written for real "hardware" terminals.  Many people use terminal
  emulators which run in a windowing environment and use
  =curses=-based applications.  Terminal emulators can duplicate all
  of the important aspects of a hardware terminal, but they do not
  have the same limitations.  The chief limitation of a hardware
  terminal from the standpoint of your application is the management
  of dataflow, i.e., timing.  Unless a hardware terminal is interfaced
  into a terminal concentrator (which does flow control), it (or your
  application) must manage dataflow, preventing overruns.  The
  cheapest solution (no hardware cost) is for your program to do this
  by pausing after operations that the terminal does slowly, such as
  clearing the display.

  As a result, many terminal descriptions (including the vt100) have
  delay times embedded.  You may wish to use these descriptions, but
  not want to pay the performance penalty.

  Set the =NCURSES_NO_PADDING= environment variable to disable all but
  mandatory padding.  Mandatory padding is used as a part of special
  control sequences such as flash.

* =NCURSES_NO_SETBUF=

  This setting is obsolete.  Before changes

  - started with 5.9 patch 20120825 and

  - continued though 5.9 patch 20130126


  =ncurses= enabled buffered output during terminal initialization.
  This was done (as in SVr4 curses) for performance reasons.  For
  testing purposes, both of =ncurses= and certain applications, this
  feature was made optional.  Setting the =NCURSES_NO_SETBUF= variable
  disabled output buffering, leaving the output in the original
  (usually line buffered) mode.

  In the current implementation, ncurses performs its own buffering
  and does not require this workaround.  It does not modify the
  buffering of the standard output.

  The reason for the change was to make the behavior for interrupts
  and other signals more robust.  One drawback is that certain
  nonconventional programs would mix ordinary stdio calls with ncurses
  calls and (usually) work.  This is no longer possible since ncurses
  is not using the buffered standard output but its own output (to the
  same file descriptor).  As a special case, the low-level calls such
  as =putp= still use the standard output.  But highlevel curses calls
  do not.

* =NCURSES_NO_UTF8_ACS=

  During initialization, the =ncurses= library checks for special
  cases where VT100 line-drawing (and the corresponding alternate
  character set capabilities) described in the terminfo are known to
  be missing.  Specifically, when running in a UTF-8 locale, the Linux
  console emulator and the GNU screen program ignore these.  =ncurses=
  checks the TERM environment variable for these.  For other special
  cases, you should set this environment variable.  Doing this tells
  ncurses to use Unicode values which correspond to the VT100
  line-drawing glyphs.  That works for the special cases cited, and is
  likely to work for terminal emulators.

  When setting this variable, you should set it to a nonzero value.
  Setting it to zero (or to a nonnumber) disables the special check
  for "linux" and "screen".

  As an alternative to the environment variable, ncurses checks for an
  extended terminfo capability =U8=.  This is a numeric capability
  which can be compiled using tic =-x=.  For example

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    # linux console, if patched to provide working
    # VT100 shift-in/shift-out, with corresponding font.
    linux-vt100|linux console with VT100 line-graphics,
            U8#0, use=linux,

    # uxterm with vt100Graphics resource set to false
    xterm-utf8|xterm relying on UTF-8 line-graphics,
            U8#1, use=xterm,
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  The name "U8" is chosen to be two characters, to permit it to be
  used by applications that use ncurses' termcap interface.

* =NCURSES_TRACE=

  During initialization, the =ncurses= debugging library checks the
  =NCURSES_TRACE= environment variable.  If it is defined, to a
  numeric value, =ncurses= calls the trace function, using that value
  as the argument.

  The argument values, which are defined in =curses=.h, provide
  several types of information.  When running with *traces* enabled,
  your application will write the file trace to the current directory.

  See [[file:curs_trace.3x.org][curs_trace(3x)]] for more information.

* TERM

  Denotes your terminal type.  Each terminal type is distinct, though
  many are similar.

  =TERM= is commonly set by terminal emulators to help applications
  find a workable terminal description.  Some of those choose a
  popular approximation, e.g., "ansi", "vt100", "xterm" rather than an
  exact fit.  Not infrequently, your application will have problems
  with that approach, e.g., incorrect function-key definitions.

  If you set =TERM= in your environment, it has no effect on the
  operation of the terminal emulator.  It only affects the way
  applications work within the terminal.  Likewise, as a general rule
  (=xterm= being a rare exception), terminal emulators which allow you
  to specify =TERM= as a parameter or configuration value do not
  change their behavior to match that setting.

* TERMCAP

  If the =ncurses= library has been configured with termcap support,
  =ncurses= will check for a terminal's description in termcap form if
  it is not available in the terminfo database.

  The =TERMCAP= environment variable contains either a terminal
  description (with newlines stripped out), or a file name telling
  where the information denoted by the =TERM= environment variable
  exists.  In either case, setting it directs =ncurses= to ignore the
  usual place for this information, e.g., /etc/termcap.

* TERMINFO

  Overrides the directory in which =ncurses= searches for your
  terminal description.  This is the simplest, but not the only way to
  change the list of directories.  The complete list of directories in
  order follows:

  - the last directory to which =ncurses= wrote, if any, is searched
    first

  - the directory specified by the =TERMINFO= environment variable

  - $HOME/.terminfo

  - directories listed in the =TERMINFO_DIRS= environment variable

  - one or more directories whose names are configured and compiled
    into the =ncurses= library, i.e.,

    - /usr/local/ncurses/share/terminfo:/usr/share/terminfo
      (corresponding to the =TERMINFO_DIRS= variable)

    - /usr/share/terminfo (corresponding to the =TERMINFO= variable)

* =TERMINFO_DIRS=

  Specifies a list of directories to search for terminal descriptions.
  The list is separated by colons (i.e., ":") on Unix, semicolons on
  OS/2 EMX.

  All of the terminal descriptions are in terminfo form.  Normally
  these are stored in a directory tree, using subdirectories named by
  the first letter of the terminal names therein.

  If =ncurses= is built with a hashed database, then each entry in
  this list can also be the path of the corresponding database file.

  If =ncurses= is built with a support for reading termcap files
  directly, then an entry in this list may be the path of a termcap
  file.

* TERMPATH

  If =TERMCAP= does not hold a file name then =ncurses= checks the
  =TERMPATH= environment variable.  This is a list of filenames
  separated by spaces or colons (i.e., ":") on Unix, semicolons on
  OS/2 EMX.

  If the =TERMPATH= environment variable is not set, =ncurses= looks
  in the files /etc/termcap, /usr/share/misc/termcap and
  $HOME/.termcap, in that order.

  The library may be configured to disregard the following variables
  when the current user is the superuser (root), or if the application
  uses setuid or setgid permissions:

  =$TERMINFO=, =$TERMINFO_DIRS=, =$TERMPATH=, as well as =$HOME=.

* ALTERNATE CONFIGURATIONS

  Several different configurations are possible, depending on the
  configure script options used when building =ncurses=.  There are a
  few main options whose effects are visible to the applications
  developer using =ncurses=:

  * =--disable-overwrite= ::

    The standard include for =ncurses= is as noted in SYNOPSIS:

    #+BEGIN_SRC c
      #include <curses.h>
    #+END_SRC

    This option is used to avoid filename conflicts when =ncurses= is
    not the main implementation of curses of the computer.  If
    =ncurses= is installed disabling =overwrite=, it puts its headers
    in a subdirectory, e.g.,

    #+BEGIN_SRC c
      #include <ncurses/curses.h>
    #+END_SRC

    It also omits a symbolic link which would allow you to use
    =-lcurses= to build executables.

  * =--enable-widec= ::

    The configure script renames the library and (if the
    =--disable-overwrite= option is used) puts the header files in a
    different subdirectory.  All of the library names have a "w"
    appended to them, i.e., instead of

    * =-lncurses= ::

      you link with

    * =-lncursesw= ::

      You must also define =_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED= when compiling for
      the wide-character library to use the extended (wide-character)
      functions.  The =curses=.h file which is installed for the
      wide-character library is designed to be compatible with the
      normal library's header.  Only the size of the =WINDOW=
      structure differs, and very few applications require more than a
      pointer to =WINDOW='s.  If the headers are installed allowing
      =overwrite=, the wide-character library's headers should be
      installed last, to allow applications to be built using either
      library from the same set of headers.

  * =--with-pthread= ::

    The configure script renames the library.  All of the library
    names have a "t" appended to them (before any "w" added by
    =--enable-widec=).

    The global variables such as =LINES= are replaced by macros to
    allow read-only access.  At the same time, setter-functions are
    provided to set these values.  Some applications (very few) may
    require changes to work with this convention.

  * =--with-shared=  ::
  * =--with-normal=  ::
  * =--with-debug=   ::
  * =--with-profile= ::

    The shared and normal (static) library names differ by their
    suffixes, e.g., =libncurses.so= and =libncurses.a=.  The debug and
    profiling libraries add a "_g" and a "_p" to the root names
    respectively, e.g., =libncurses_g.a= and =libncurses_p.a=.

  * =--with-trace= ::

    The =trace= function normally resides in the debug library, but it
    is sometimes useful to configure this in the shared library.
    Configure scripts should check for the function's existence rather
    than assuming it is always in the debug library.

* FILES

  - /usr/share/tabset ::

    directory containing initialization files for the terminal
    capability database /usr/share/terminfo terminal capability
    database

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:terminfo.5.org][terminfo(5)]] and related pages whose names begin "curs_" for detailed
  routine descriptions.  [[file:curs_variables.3x.org][curs_variables(3x)]]

* EXTENSIONS

  The =ncurses= library can be compiled with an option
  (=-DUSE_GETCAP=) that falls back to the old-style /etc/termcap file
  if the terminal setup code cannot find a terminfo entry
  corresponding to =TERM=.  Use of this feature is not recommended, as
  it essentially includes an entire termcap compiler in the =ncurses=
  startup code, at significant cost in core and startup cycles.

  The =ncurses= library includes facilities for capturing mouse events
  on certain terminals (including xterm).  See the [[file:curs_mouse.3x.org][curs_mouse(3x)]]
  manual page for details.

  The =ncurses= library includes facilities for responding to window
  resizing events, e.g., when running in an xterm.  See the
  [[file:resizeterm.3x.org][resizeterm(3x)]] and [[file:wresize.3x.org][wresize(3x)]] manual pages for details.  In
  addition, the library may be configured with a =SIGWINCH= handler.

  The =ncurses= library extends the fixed set of function key
  capabilities of terminals by allowing the application designer to
  define additional key sequences at runtime.  See the [[file:define_key.3x.org][define_key(3x)]]
  [[file:key_defined.3x.org][key_defined(3x)]], and [[file:keyok.3x.org][keyok(3x)]] manual pages for details.

  The =ncurses= library can exploit the capabilities of terminals
  which implement the ISO-6429 SGR 39 and SGR 49 controls, which allow
  an application to reset the terminal to its original foreground and
  background colors.  From the users' perspective, the application is
  able to draw colored text on a background whose color is set
  independently, providing better control over color contrasts.  See
  the [[file:default_colors.3x.org][default_colors(3x)]] manual page for details.

  The =ncurses= library includes a function for directing application
  output to a printer attached to the terminal device.  See the
  [[file:curs_print.3x.org][curs_print(3x)]] manual page for details.

* PORTABILITY

  The =ncurses= library is intended to be BASE-level conformant with
  XSI Curses.  The EXTENDED XSI Curses functionality (including color
  support) is supported.

  A small number of local differences (that is, individual differences
  between the XSI Curses and =ncurses= calls) are described in
  *PORTABILITY* sections of the library man pages.

  Unlike other implementations, this one checks parameters such as
  pointers to =WINDOW= structures to ensure they are not null.  The
  main reason for providing this behavior is to guard against
  programmer error.  The standard interface does not provide a way for
  the library to tell an application which of several possible errors
  were detected.  Relying on this (or some other) extension will
  adversely affect the portability of =curses= applications.

  This implementation also contains several extensions:

  * The routine =has_key= is not part of XPG4, nor is it present in
    SVr4.  See the [[file:curs_getch.3x.org][curs_getch(3x)]] manual page for details.

  * The routine =slk_attr= is not part of XPG4, nor is it present in
    SVr4.  See the [[file:curs_slk.3x.org][curs_slk(3x)]] manual page for details.

  * The routines =getmouse=, =mousemask=, =ungetmouse=,
    =mouseinterval=, and =wenclose= relating to mouse interfacing are
    not part of XPG4, nor are they present in SVr4.  See the
    [[file:curs_mouse.3x.org][curs_mouse(3x)]] manual page for details.

  * The routine =mcprint= was not present in any previous =curses=
    implementation.  See the [[file:curs_print.3x.org][curs_print(3x)]] manual page for details.

  * The routine =wresize= is not part of XPG4, nor is it present in
    SVr4.  See the [[file:wresize.3x.org][wresize(3x)]] manual page for details.

  * The =WINDOW= structure's internal details can be hidden from
    application programs.  See [[file:curs_opaque.3x.org][curs_opaque(3x)]] for the discussion of
    =is_scrollok=, etc.

  * This implementation can be configured to provide rudimentary
    support for multi-threaded applications.  See [[file:curs_threads.3x.org][curs_threads(3x)]] for
    details.

  * This implementation can also be configured to provide a set of
    functions which improve the ability to manage multiple screens.
    See [[file:curs_sp_funcs.3x.org][curs_sp_funcs(3x)]] for details.


  In historic curses versions, delays embedded in the capabilities
  =cr=, =ind=, =cub1=, =ff= and =tab= activated corresponding delay
  bits in the UNIX tty driver.  In this implementation, all padding is
  done by sending NUL bytes.  This method is slightly more expensive,
  but narrows the interface to the UNIX kernel significantly and
  increases the package's portability correspondingly.

* NOTES

  The header file =<curses.h>= automatically includes the header files
  =<stdio.h>= and =<unctrl.h>=.

  If standard output from a =ncurses= program is re-directed to
  something which is not a tty, screen updates will be directed to
  standard error.  This was an undocumented feature of AT&T System V
  Release 3 =curses=.
