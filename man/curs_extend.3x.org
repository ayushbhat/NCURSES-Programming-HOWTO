* NAME

  =curses_version=, =use_extended_names= - miscellaneous =curses=
  extensions

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    const char * curses_version(void);
    int use_extended_names(bool enable);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These functions are extensions to the =curses= library which do not
  fit easily into other categories.

  Use =curses_version()= to get the version number, including patch
  level of the library, e.g., *5.0.19991023*

  The =use_extended_names()= function controls whether the calling
  application is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names which
  may be compiled into the terminfo description, i.e., via the
  terminfo or termcap interfaces.  Normally these names are available
  for use, since the essential decision is made by using the =-x=
  option of =tic= to compile extended terminal definitions.  However
  you can disable this feature to ensure compatibility with other
  implementations of =curses=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
