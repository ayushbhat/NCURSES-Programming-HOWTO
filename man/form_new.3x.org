* NAME

  =new_form=, =free_form= - create and destroy forms

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>
    FORM *new_form(FIELD **fields);
    int free_form(FORM *form);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =new_form= creates a new form connected to a specified
  field pointer array (which must be =NULL=-terminated).

  The function =free_form= disconnects form from its field array and
  frees the storage allocated for the form.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =new_form= returns =NULL= on error.  It sets =errno=
  according to the function's success:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  - =E_CONNECTED=    :: The field is already connected to a form.

  - =E_SYSTEM_ERROR= :: System error occurred, e.g., malloc failure.


  The function =free_form= returns one of the following:

  - =E_OK=           :: The routine succeeded.

  - =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= :: Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range
                        argument.

  - =E_POSTED=       :: The form has already been posted.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V forms  library.   They
  were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.
