* NAME

  =set_menu_spacing=, =menu_spacing= - Control spacing between menu
  items.

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int set_menu_spacing(MENU *menu,
                         int spc_description,
                         int spc_rows,
                         int spc_columns);
    int menu_spacing(const MENU *menu,
                     int* spc_description,
                     int* spc_rows,
                     int* spc_columns);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  The function =set_menu_spacing= sets the spacing information for the
  menu.  Its parameter =spc_description= controls the number of spaces
  between an item name and an item description.  It must not be larger
  than =TABSIZE=.  The menu system puts in the middle of this spacing
  area the pad character.  The remaining parts are filled with spaces.
  The =spc_rows= parameter controls the number of rows that are used
  for an item.  It must not be larger than 3.  The menu system inserts
  the blank lines between item rows, these lines will contain the pad
  character in the appropriate positions.  The =spc_columns= parameter
  controls the number of blanks between columns of items.  It must not
  be larger than =TABSIZE=.  A value of 0 for all the spacing values
  resets them to the default, which is 1 for all of them.  The
  function =menu_spacing= passes back the spacing info for the menu.
  If a pointer is =NULL=, this specific info is simply not returned.

* RETURN VALUE

  Both routines return =E_OK= on success.  set_menu_spacing may return
  =E_POSTED= if the menu is posted, or =E_BAD_ARGUMENT= if one of the
  spacing values is out of range.

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
