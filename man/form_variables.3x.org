  variables

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <form.h>

    FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ALNUM;
    FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ALPHA;
    FIELDTYPE * TYPE_ENUM;

* DESCRIPTION

  These are building blocks for the form library, defining fields that
  can be created using [[file:form_fieldtype.3x.org][form_fieldtype(3x)]].  Each provides functions
  for field- and character-validation, according to the given
  datatype.

  - =TYPE_ALNUM=   :: This holds alphanumeric data.

  - =TYPE_ALPHA=   :: This holds alphabetic data.

  - =TYPE_ENUM=    :: This holds an enumerated type.

  - =TYPE_INTEGER= :: This holds a decimal integer.

  - =TYPE_IPV4=    :: This holds an IPv4 internet address, e.g.,
                      "127.0.0.1".

  - =TYPE_NUMERIC= :: This holds a decimal number, with optional sign
                      and decimal point.

  - =TYPE_REGEXP=  :: This holds a regular expression.

* PORTABILITY

  The =TYPE_IPV4= variable is an extension not provided by older
  implementations of the form library.
