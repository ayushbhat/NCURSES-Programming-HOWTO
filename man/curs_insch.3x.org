* NAME

  =insch=, =winsch=, =mvinsch=, =mvwinsch= - insert a character before
  cursor in a =curses= window

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int insch(chtype ch);
    int winsch(WINDOW *win, chtype ch);
    int mvinsch(int y, int x, chtype ch);
    int mvwinsch(WINDOW *win, int y, int x, chtype ch);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  These routines insert the character =ch= before the character under
  the cursor.  All characters to the right of the cursor are moved one
  space to the right, with the possibility of the rightmost character
  on the line being lost.  The insertion operation does not change the
  cursor position.

* RETURN VALUE

  All routines that return an integer return =ERR= upon failure and
  =OK= (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than =ERR=") upon
  successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the preceding
  routine descriptions.

  Functions with a "mv" prefix first perform a cursor movement using
  =wmove=, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
  or if the window pointer is null.

* NOTES

  These routines do not necessarily imply use of a hardware insert
  character feature.

  Note that =insch=, =mvinsch=, and =mvwinsch= may be macros.

* PORTABILITY

  These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.

  Comparable functions in the wide-character (ncursesw) library are
