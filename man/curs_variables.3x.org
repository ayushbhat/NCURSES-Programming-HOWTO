* DESCRIPTION

  This page summarizes variables provided by the =curses= library.  A
  more complete description is given in the [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]] manual page.

  Depending on the configuration, these may be actual variables, or
  macros (see [[file:curs_threads.3x.org][curs_threads(3x)]] and [[file:curs_opaque.3x.org][curs_opaque(3x)]]) which provide
  read-only access to /curses/'s state.  In either case, applications
  should treat them as read-only to avoid confusing the library.

** =COLOR_PAIRS=

   After initializing =curses=, this variable contains the number of
   color pairs which the terminal can support.  Usually the number of
   color pairs will be the product =COLORS*COLORS=, however this is
   not always true:

   * a few terminals use HLS colors, which do not follow this rule

   * terminals supporting a large number of colors are limited by the
     number of color pairs that can be represented in a signed short
     value.

** =COLORS=

   After initializing curses, this variable contains the number of
   colors which the terminal can support.

** =COLS=

   After initializing curses, this variable contains the width of the
   screen, i.e., the number of columns.

** =ESCDELAY=

   This variable holds the number of milliseconds to wait after
   reading an escape character, to distinguish between an individual
   escape character entered on the keyboard from escape sequences sent
   by cursor- and function-keys (see [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]].

** =LINES=

   After initializing curses, this variable contains the height of the
   screen, i.e., the number of lines.

** =TABSIZE=

   This variable holds the number of columns used by the curses
   library when converting a tab character to spaces as it adds the
   tab to a window (see [[file:curs_addch.3x.org][curs_addch(3x)]].

** The Current Screen

   This implementation of curses uses a special window =curscr= to
   record its updates to the terminal screen.

** The New Screen

   This implementation of curses uses a special window =newscr= to
   hold updates to the terminal screen before applying them to
   =curscr=.

** The Standard Screen

   Upon initializing curses, a default window called =stdscr=, which
   is the size of the terminal screen, is created.  Many curses
   functions use this window.

* NOTES

  The curses library is initialized using either [[file:curs_initscr.3x.org][curs_initscr(3x)]], or
  [[file:curs_initscr.3x.org][curs_initscr(3x)]].

  If =curses= is configured to use separate =curses=/=terminfo=
  libraries, most of these variables reside in the =curses= library.

* PORTABILITY

  =ESCDELAY= and =TABSIZE= are extensions, not provided in most other
  implementations of curses.

  =ESCDELAY= is an extension in AIX =curses=:

  * In AIX, the units for =ESCDELAY= are fifths of a millisecond.

  * The default value for AIX's =ESCDELAY= is 0.1 seconds.

  * AIX also enforces a limit of 10,000 seconds for =ESCDELAY=; this
    implementation currently has no upper limit.


  This implementation has long used =ESCDELAY= with units of
  milliseconds, making it impossible to be completely compatible with
  AIX.  Likewise, most users have either decided to override the
  value, or rely upon its default value.
