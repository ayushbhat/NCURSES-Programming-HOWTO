* NAME

  =tabs= - set tabs on a terminal

* SYNOPSIS

  =tabs= [options]] [tabstop-list]

* DESCRIPTION

  The =tabs= program clears and sets tab-stops on the terminal.  This
  uses the terminfo =clear_all_tabs= and =set_tab= capabilities.  If
  either is absent, =tabs= is unable to clear/set tab-stops.  The
  terminal should be configured to use hard tabs, e.g.,

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    stty tab0
  #+END_EXAMPLE

* OPTIONS

** General Options

   * =-Tname= ::

     Tell tabs which terminal type to use.  If this option is not
     given, tabs will use the =$TERM= environment variable.  If that
     is not set, it will use the ansi+tabs entry.

   * =-d= ::

     The debugging option shows a ruler line, followed by two data
     lines.  The first data line shows the expected tab-stops marked
     with asterisks.  The second data line shows the actual tab-stops,
     marked with asterisks.

   * =-n= ::

     This option tells =tabs= to check the options and run any
     debugging option, but not to modify the terminal settings.

   * =-V= ::

     reports the version of =ncurses= which was used in this program,
     and exits.


   The =tabs= program processes a single list of tab stops.  The last
   option to be processed which defines a list is the one that
   determines the list to be processed.

** Implicit Lists

   Use a single number as an option, e.g., "=-5=" to set tabs at the
   given interval (in this case 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, etc.).  Tabs are
   repeated up to the right margin of the screen.

   Use "=-0=" to clear all tabs.

   Use "=-8=" to set tabs to the standard interval.

** Explicit Lists

   An explicit list can be defined after the options (this does not
   use a "-").  The values in the list must be in increasing numeric
   order, and greater than zero.  They are separated by a comma or a
   blank, for example,

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     tabs 1,6,11,16,21
     tabs 1 6 11 16 21
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Use a '+' to treat a number as an increment relative to the
   previous value, e.g.,

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     tabs 1,+5,+5,+5,+5
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   which is equivalent to the 1,6,11,16,21 example.

** Predefined Tab-Stops

   X/Open defines several predefined lists of tab stops.

   * =-a=  ::  Assembler, IBM S/370, first format

   * =-a2= :: Assembler, IBM S/370, second format

   * =-c=  :: COBOL, normal format

   * =-c2= :: COBOL compact format

   * =-c3= :: COBOL compact format extended

   * =-f=  :: FORTRAN

   * =-p=  :: PL/I

   * =-s=  :: SNOBOL

   * =-u=  :: UNIVAC 1100 Assembler

* PORTABILITY

  X/Open describes a =+m= option, to set a terminal's leftmargin.
  Very few of the entries in the terminal database provide this
  capability.

  The =-d= (debug) and =-n= (no-op) options are extensions not
  provided by other implementations.

  Documentation for other implementations states that there is a limit
  on the number of tab stops.  While some terminals may not accept an
  arbitrary number of tab stops, this implementation will attempt to
  set tab stops up to the right margin of the screen, if the given
  list happens to be that long.
