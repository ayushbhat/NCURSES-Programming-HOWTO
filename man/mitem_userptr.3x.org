* NAME

  =set_item_userptr=, =item_userptr= - associate application data with
  a menu item

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <menu.h>
    int set_item_userptr(ITEM *item, void *userptr);
    void *item_userptr(const ITEM *item);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  Every menu item has a field that can be used to hold
  application-specific data (that is, the menu-driver code leaves it
  alone).  These functions get and set that field.

* RETURN VALUE

  The function =item_userptr= returns a pointer (possibly =NULL=).  It
  does not set =errno=.

  The =set_item_userptr= always returns =E_OK= (success).

* SEE ALSO

  [[file:ncurses.3x.org][curses(3x)]], [[file:menu.3x.org][menu(3x)]].

* NOTES

  The header file =<menu.h>= automatically includes the header file
  =<curses.h>=.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines emulate the System V menu library.  They were not
  supported on Version 7 or BSD versions.

  The user pointer is a void pointer.  We chose not to leave it as a
  char pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
