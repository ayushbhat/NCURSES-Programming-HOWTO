* NAME

  =define_key= - define a keycode

* SYNOPSIS

  #+BEGIN_SRC c
    #include <curses.h>

    int define_key(const char *definition, int keycode);
  #+END_SRC

* DESCRIPTION

  This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
  application to define keycodes with their corresponding control
  strings, so that the ncurses library will interpret them just as it
  would the predefined codes in the terminfo database.

  If the given string is null, any existing definition for the keycode
  is removed.  Similarly, if the given keycode is negative or zero,
  any existing string for the given definition is removed.

* RETURN VALUE

  The keycode must be greater than zero, and the string nonnull,
  otherwise =ERR= is returned.  =ERR= may also be returned if there is
  insufficient memory to allocate the data to store the definition.
  If no error is detected, =OK= is returned.

* PORTABILITY

  These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
  Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
  any code depending on them be conditioned using =NCURSES_VERSION=.
